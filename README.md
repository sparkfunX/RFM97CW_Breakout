[*SparkFun RFM97C Mini Shield LoRa - 100mW (SPX-18574)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18574)

The RFM97C is a great little module that incorporates the [SX1276 LoRa transceiver](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-core/sx1276) from Semtech. LoRa is best for long range communication (hundreds of feet), low power, and low data rates (~500bps). This 'Mini Shield' is designed to be attached to the top or bottom of any of our Thing Plus boards. Pictured is the [ESP32 Thing Plus](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18018). We include a PTH soldering point for a low cost wire antenna (~3" for 915MHz) along side a stress relief hole. For folks that need a bit more oomph, there is a U.FL connector available for larger, external RP-SMA LoRa antennas.

Our example sketches make quick work of the initial setup, and the RadioLib Arduino Library makes advanced configuration and [protocols](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib/wiki/Default-configuration#protocols) (AX.25, Hellschreiber, Morse, RTTY, and SSTV) a cinch too!
